usage: scripts/fetch_model.sh <tinystories|barista>

Downloads that model's released files. The inference assets are checked against
a SHA-256 and byte size pinned in this script; metadata.json carries no pinned
hash, so it is parsed and cross-checked against those same pins instead. Only
then is anything installed into artifacts/<model>/.

Nothing is installed unless every check passes, so a failed or partial download
leaves whatever is already in artifacts/ untouched.

Then flash with:
