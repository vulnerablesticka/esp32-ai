The model is mandatory: the board holds one at a time, and deploying replaces
whatever is already there, so which one is being written is never implied.
The board defaults to devkit (generic ESP32-S3, 16MB flash) if omitted.
xiao_s3 targets the Seeed XIAO ESP32S3 (8MB flash): barista (~4.6MB) and
knots (~1.25MB pilot) both fit there; tinystories' model.bin is ~14.9MB, too
big for 8MB flash.

Generates that model's device headers, runs the applicable host gates including
the golden gate when present, compiles, and only then writes the model partition
and the firmware.

Artifact paths may be overridden: ARTIFACTS, MODEL, TOKENIZER, GOLDEN, and for
barista and knots also VOCAB and LAYOUT.
